# project-euler
Solutions to project Euler problems. 

Note: Project Euler is amazing. I've been tinkering around with it for years and am publishing these solutions in accordance with their rules. Nothing over problem #100 will be posted publicly 
 
*Please don't use these solutions to just copy + paste the solutions!*

I hope to iterate over the code to clean them up, find new ways of solving them and improve performance. Also excited to learn new programming languages with the exercises, and will defintely be leaning on others' code here on Github to learn new and clever ways of doing things.
